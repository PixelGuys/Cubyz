## We do not accept low-effort content suggestions

It is easy to suggest something, but often it's much harder to implement and check if it fits the game.
So, before making a suggestion here on github (you can of course freely discuss ideas on the community discord server), please do the following steps:

- check if it follows the [Game Design Principles](https://github.com/PixelGuys/Cubyz/blob/master/docs/GAME_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md)
- make a reference implementation in the form of an addon, mod or fork of Cubyz (no content from other games)
- create a pull request with the suggested changes or make an issue using the blank issue template, don't forget to add some screenshots
