# Cubyz is NOT a Survival Game!
The goal of this project is to create a game about exploration and adventure, not survival. Our additions are inspired by reality, not copied from it.

### Avoid Unavoidable Threats
A player should have to create or approach a threat on their own terms, rather than the threat approach them.
**This is a key part of Cubyz game design, as it is what keeps it from being a survival game.**

**Examples:**
- A player has lost much health, and must risk what little life they have left to gather food. Note that the player cannot heal unless they have an accessory that consumes their energy. This is a situation the player has to face because of their own skill level.
- A player will not be attacked by monsters at night. They have to actively approach a monster-infested place such as a structure or cave. This is so they have free reign to do tasks during the night.
- A player summons an event that spawns waves of enemies to their base.

### Progression = Risk
In order to progress in the game, the player must take risks. The player is otherwise free to stay where they are in terms of progression.

**Examples:**
- The deeper the player goes into the world's caves, the more valuables they can find, but consequentially, the more monsters they'll come across.
- The player must defeat an enemy, boss, or event to obtain an item that helps them progress.
- In a multiplayer world, a player might have to attack an enemy player to rise up in power.

# Break the Cycle
### No Dimensions
Large dimension-like areas can be placed within the world itself, as it's immensely big already.
"Dimensions" such as an underworld and an overworld are already planned for the game.

### No Teleportation
We want the player to create infrastructure for travelling. Long-range teleportation would make this useless.

### No Automation
The player should have to explore the world to find resources, not just stay in one place and farm everything.

### No Generic Creatures
Cubyz' creatures should not copy from real life or Minecraft.

### No Passive Animals
To make hunting more engaging, animals will run from the player, attack back, and use defense mechanisms.

### Beds shouldn't set spawn
Being able to set your spawn anywhere is very powerful, so whatever sets your spawn in this game should be immovable or consumable.

# Player Engagement
### "How would the player feel?"
This is a very important part of game design in general. When a player encounters and re-encounters a mechanic or feature, put yourself in the player's shoes and ask "how would the player feel?" The goal is to make the player feel what you want them to feel, whether that be satisfaction, frustration, excitement, fear, or all of the above! It also helps to ask for feedback from players and asking how they feel about your addition.

### Make the World Feel Alive

### Depth in Simplicity
Cubyz' special sauce is its simplicity. Keeping everything simple on the surface makes the game approachable for beginners, while the hidden depth keeps it interesting for skilled players. Avoid features that would add unnecessary tedium to the player's experience. Always think about how it would effect the player's first impressions of the game.

### Fuel the Player's Curiosity
The world is filled with secrets, and we want the player to find these secrets on their own without any outside help or guide.

### Problems have Multiple Solutions
Problems faced in a particular age of progression should have multiple solutions, instead of just one solution for everything.
For example, in the "Pre-Caves Age," the player will not have access to coal, as coal spawns low in the world and is shrouded in darkness. There's many solutions to this, however:
- Find a dim, above ground light source.
- Search for a cave with exposed coal.
- Wander into the darkness to find a cave that's bright enough to mine in.
- Find an above-ground structure that can grant the player coal.
- Dig straight down until you find coal.

Of course, this problem is completely solved as soon as the player gets coal, as they can now explore caves to find more coal with their newfound torches, but it's important that the player has these options in the first place so they can have more freedom. Not one option is better or easier than the other, and if one turns out to be, then it should be allowed to be adjusted to encourage other methods.

### Explain when Needed
If something progress-related has no obvious explanation, the player will have to rely on a wiki to find out how to progress. One example is the bellows; players won't know to place it next to a furnace and jump on it repeatedly. The issue can be fixed by adding a tooltip that tells them how it works, while leaving out details they can intuitively find out themselves.

### Micro Moments
These are tiny things the player does in between larger events; examples include:
- Travelling
- Parkour
- Mining
- Building
- Crafting
- Managing inventory
- Fighting

These moments are extremely important as they let the player mentally rest, so making sure they're as satisfying and consistent as possible is a must.

# Balancing
When balancing the game, keep in mind how players might interact with the world, the wildlife, and each other.

### 2OP4ME
At no point should the player be extremely hard to kill. Armor, tools, accessories, and buffs should be designed around aiding the player in skill-based encounters, not making them win regardless of skill.

### Trade-offs
If the player is given a powerful ability, then it should have an appropriate downside that forces them to use said ability or interact with other mechanics.

**Examples:**
- An accessory that gives the player a double-jump, but increases their fall damage.
- An accessory that heals the player, but takes away energy or some other resource.
- Armor that grants a lot of defense, but makes the player slow.
- A golden pickaxe is strong, but uses rare resources and is slow to swing.

### No Unbreakable Tools
There should be no way to make tool last indefinitely.

# Little Details

### Big Trees vs Small Trees
There are two categories of trees, big and small. Big trees are designed to be built upon or left as decoration, whereas small trees are designed to be chopped down.
